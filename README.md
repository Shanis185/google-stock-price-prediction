# Stock Price Prediction using Facebook Prophet Model
#### This project demonstrates how to predict the stock prices of Google using the Facebook Prophet model. The dataset used in this project contains historical stock prices obtained from Yahoo Finance. Prophet, a forecasting tool developed by Facebook, is used to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Overview
#### In this project, we will:

#### Load the historical stock data (Google in this case) from a CSV file.
#### Preprocess the data to fit the requirements of the Facebook Prophet model.
#### Use the Prophet model to predict stock prices for the next 365 days.
#### Visualize the historical stock prices, the predicted stock prices, and seasonal trends.
## Prerequisites
#### To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

#### pandas for data manipulation.
#### numpy for numerical operations.
#### matplotlib for plotting graphs.
#### fbprophet for stock price prediction.

## steps
#### 1. Download the Dataset
#### 2. Import the Required Libraries
#### 3. Upload the Dataset
#### 4. Visualize the Stock Data
#### 5. Prepare the Data for Prophet
#### 6. Fit the Data to the Prophet Model
#### 7. Make Predictions
#### 8. Visualize the Seasonal Components

## Output
#### The output consists of:

### A plot showing the historical Google stock prices.
### A plot showing the predicted stock prices for the next 365 days.
### A component plot showing the seasonal effects in the stock prices.

## Conclusion
### This project showcases how to use the Facebook Prophet model to predict future stock prices based on historical data. By following this approach, you can apply the same methodology to predict stock prices for other companies or financial data.
